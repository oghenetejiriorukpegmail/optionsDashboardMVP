## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
The Options-Technical Hybrid Scanner is a trading tool designed to empower retail traders by providing a systematic, data-driven method to identify trading opportunities in volatile stocks, such as TSLA. It implements the "Options-Technical Hybrid Strategy" framework, which combines options data and technical analysis to help traders:
- Analyze market context (trend, sentiment, and momentum).
- Identify key price levels using options chain metrics.
- Define bullish, bearish, or neutral trade setups.
- Confirm precise entry and exit points.
- Manage risk effectively.

The scanner aims to simplify complex market dynamics into actionable insights, targeting short-to-medium-term trades (1 to 4 weeks), while remaining adaptable for other time frames with adjustments.

### **1.2 Target Audience**
Retail traders with basic to intermediate knowledge of options and technical analysis, seeking a repeatable process to trade volatile stocks like TSLA.

## **2. Features and Functionalities**

The scanner is structured around five core modules from the "Options-Technical Hybrid Strategy" framework, plus a scanning feature to filter stocks and deliver real-time insights.

### **2.1 Market Context Analysis Module**
This module evaluates the market environment using technical indicators and options data.

- **Trend Identification:**
  - Calculate and display 10-day, 20-day, and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs).
  - Classify trends as:
    - **Bullish:** 10 EMA > 20 EMA > 50 EMA.
    - **Bearish:** 10 EMA < 20 EMA < 50 EMA.
    - **Neutral:** EMAs are flat or converging (within 1% of each other).
- **Sentiment and Volatility:**
  - Display Put-Call Ratio (PCR) with adjustable thresholds based on Implied Volatility (IV):
    - Bullish: PCR < 0.7 (low IV), < 0.8 (moderate IV), < 0.5 (high IV).
    - Bearish: PCR > 1.3 (low IV), > 1.2 (moderate IV), > 1.5 (high IV).
  - Display Volume-Weighted Implied Volatility (VWIV) to identify active trading zones.
  - Display Gamma Exposure (GEX):
    - Positive GEX (> $500M): Bullish stability.
    - Negative GEX (< -$500M): Bearish pressure.
    - Near zero (< $200M): Potential breakout.
  - Integrate social media sentiment (e.g., from X/Web) to complement PCR.
- **Momentum Assessment:**
  - Display 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI).
  - Display Stochastic RSI to detect overbought/oversold conditions.

### **2.2 Key Levels Mapping Module**
This module uses options chain data to pinpoint critical support and resistance levels.

- **Options Chain Analysis:**
  - Display Open Interest (OI) for call and put options across strikes.
  - Display options volume to confirm trader activity.
  - Display key Greeks:
    - Gamma (> 0.05 indicates pinning zones).
    - Charm (positive supports trends, negative fades them).
    - Vanna (high values signal IV sensitivity).
    - Vomma (> 0.1 highlights IV convexity in high-IV scenarios).
- **Max Pain Calculation:**
  - Calculate and display the Max Pain point, where option writers incur the least loss, acting as a price magnet near expiration.

### **2.3 Trade Setup Rules Engine**
This module defines conditions for trade setups.

- **Bullish Setup:**
  - Strong bullish trend (EMA alignment).
  - PCR below threshold (e.g., < 0.8 in moderate IV).
  - RSI between 55-80, Stochastic RSI > 60.
  - Price near support (e.g., 10 EMA) with high OI or gamma in calls above.
  - Positive GEX (> $500M), high vanna/vomma.
- **Bearish Setup:**
  - Strong bearish trend (EMA alignment).
  - PCR above threshold (e.g., > 1.2 in moderate IV).
  - RSI between 20-45, Stochastic RSI < 40.
  - Price near resistance with high OI or gamma in puts below.
  - Negative GEX (< -$500M), high vanna/vomma.
- **Neutral Setup:**
  - Neutral trend (flat EMAs).
  - PCR between 0.8-1.2, IV < 40%.
  - RSI between 45-65, Stochastic RSI between 25-75.
  - Price near Max Pain with high gamma and low vomma.

### **2.4 Confirmation and Timing Module**
This module provides entry and exit signals.

- **Entry Triggers:**
  - Bullish: Stochastic RSI hooks up from < 60, with volume spike and rising vanna/vomma/GEX.
  - Bearish: Stochastic RSI hooks down from > 40, with volume spike and similar options activity.
  - Neutral: Price stalls at Max Pain with high gamma/GEX and flat VWIV/vomma.
- **Exit Triggers:**
  - RSI extremes (> 80 or < 20).
  - Stochastic RSI reversals.
  - Price reaching high OI or GEX strikes.

### **2.5 Risk Management Module**
This module offers risk control suggestions.

- **Position Sizing:**
  - Suggest sizes based on IV (e.g., 1.5% of account at 45% IV) and GEX (smaller positions in extreme GEX scenarios).
- **Stop Loss:**
  - Suggest levels at key support/resistance (e.g., EMA breaks) or 1-2% loss thresholds.

### **2.6 Scanner Feature**
The scanner filters stocks and delivers actionable insights.

- **Custom Filters:**
  - Users can set parameters for trend, sentiment, momentum, key levels, and trade setups (e.g., PCR < 0.8, RSI 55-80).
- **Real-Time Alerts:**
  - Notifications (email, SMS, or in-app) when stocks meet criteria.
- **Visualizations:**
  - EMA crossover charts.
  - RSI and Stochastic RSI plots.
  - OI and gamma distribution across strikes.
  - Tables or graphs for key Greeks (gamma, vanna, vomma).
