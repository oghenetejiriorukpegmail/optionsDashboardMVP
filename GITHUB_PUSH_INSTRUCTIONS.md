   - Name the repository "optionsDashboardMVP"
   - Optionally add a description
   - Choose public or private visibility
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Connect your local repository to GitHub (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):

     - Add a note (e.g., "optionsDashboardMVP")
     - Select scopes: at minimum, check "repo"
